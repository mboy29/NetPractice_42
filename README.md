### LEVEL 01 :

In order for my PC and my little brother's to communicate, the two interface need to have the same subnet mask and have IP addresses from the same rang (same goes for connecting my Mac and my little sister's computer):
- 104.96.23.1 - 104.96.23.254 /24 ;
- 221.191.0.1 - 221.191.255.254 /16.

### LEVEL 02 :

Same goes for this level :
- 92.168.1.1 - 92.168.1.2 /30 ;
- 192.168.65.193 - 192.168.65.222 /27.

### LEVEL 03 :

In order to for interfaces from the same network switch all interfaces need to have the same subnet and belong to the same range of IP addresses : 104.198.212.129 - 104.198.212.254 /25.

### LEVEL 04 :

Same goes here : 82.78.118.1 - 82.78.119.254 / 23.

### LEVEL 05 :

As seen before, for two interfaces to communicate they need to share the same subnet mask and have IP addresses form the same range. However, for two interface to communicate that don't belong to the same network we have to use a gateway.

A gateway is composed of one IP address with a subnet mask (where we come from) and another IP address (where we are going). Where we come from can be composed of a default IP address and a default mask : 0.0.0.0/0).

### LEVEL 06 :

A internet interfaces work the same way as a gateway. However, the IP address and the subnet mask of where i come from can't be set to a default value. Else, see level03 in order to configure the interfaces connect to a network switch.

### LEVEL 07 :

A internet interfaces work the same way as a gateway. However, the IP address and the subnet mask of where i come from can't be set to a default value. Else, see level03 in order to configure the interfaces connect to a network switch.
